# Docker for Windows Beta

When you start the app for the first time, you'll be asked to enter your invitation code (token). Your private invitation code is:

```
pass docker-windows-beta | pbcopy
```

Please note that these apps are under active development! We do expect things to break and with your feedback we'll be working hard to fix bugs, implement new features, and make design improvements.
